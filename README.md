#Mastering React Native
This is the code repository for [Mastering React Native](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-react-native?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885785), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
React Native has completely revolutionized mobile development by empowering JavaScript developers to build world-class mobile apps that run natively on mobile platforms. This book will show you how to apply JavaScript and other front-end skills to build cross-platform React Native applications for iOS and Android using a single codebase.


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
HTML: <div class="news-item">
JSX: <div className="news-item">
```

While we will add Android support to our project in later chapters, the majority of this
book focuses on iOS development. In order to develop for iOS, you must have access to an
Apple Mac computer capable of running Xcode 7 or later. Xcode is only necessary for
building and testing React Native apps. You’re welcome to edit your code in any editor or
IDE of your choosing.
In addition to Xcode, React Native requires a few other tools. These include Homebrew,
Node.js (6.5.0 or later), npm (3.10.3 or later), Watchman, the React Native CLI, and Google
Chrome for debugging. We’ll explain what all these tools are and how to install them in
Chapter 2, Saying Hello World in React Native.
In Chapter 9, Refactoring for Android, we’ll update our project so it can run on both
platforms. Android has its own set of software requirements including the Java
Development Kit (JDK 1.8 or later) and Android Studio. Once again, we’ll walk you
through how to install and configure these tools in Chapter 9, Refactoring for Android.
Finally, in Chapter 12, React Native Tools & Resources, we’ll evaluate software that can aid
your React Native workflow and allow you to build React Native apps for even more
platforms. All of these installations are completely optional. However, it’s worth noting that
the React Native plugin for Universal Windows Platform will require a computer or virtual
machine running Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 Community.
